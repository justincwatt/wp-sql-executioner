Execute arbitrary SQL queries against your WordPress database from the Admin.

== Description ==

Instead of needing a tool like [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php) 
or the mysql command line client to view and modify your WordPress database, 
the SQL Executioner allows you to run arbitrary SQL queries against your 
WordPress database from within the Admin. In many cases this allows you to bypass
the inherent limitations of the WordPress Admin interface, and use the full expressive
power of SQL to analyze and update your blog's database.

To use simply install and visit the Tools > SQL Executioner page.

If you're interested in contributing to the code behind this plugin, it's also hosted on GitHub:
https://github.com/justincwatt/wp-sql-executioner

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file, drop the sql-executioner folder in your wp-content/plugins/ 
directory, and then activate from the Plugins page.

== REST API ==

To enable API access to your SQL database, add a line to `wp-config.php`:

  define('SQLEXECUTIONER_KEY', '<your secret key goes here>');

This will activate an API endpoint at

  /wp-json/sql-executioner/v1/result

which accepts JSON-formatted SQL queries like this:

  wget -O - --header='Content-Type: application/json' --post-data='{"sql": "SELECT 1;", "time": <seconds since 1970 go here>, "hmac": "<HMAC goes here>"}' 'http://your-domain.com/wp-json/sql-executioner/v1/result'

and the HMAC is computed as

  $hmac = hash_hmac('sha256', time() . ":" . $sql, SQLEXECUTIONER_KEY);

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin have any undo? =

No. It executes SQL queries directly against your database. If in doubt, run a `SELECT` 
query before attempting an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` query to confirm what
you are about to modify.

= Can I irreparably damage my WordPress database using this plugin? =

Yes.

= Do I have to know SQL to use this plugin? =

Yes. Other than a basic facility that will `DESCRIBE` each table for you, there 
is no GUI (graphical user interface).
